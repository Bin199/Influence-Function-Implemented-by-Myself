# Influence-Function-Implemented-by-Myself
This repository contains the code of influence function using PyTorch framework. I run the code on Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU successfully.

# Why do I start this program?
I engaged in one another program Digital Retirement, which requires collecting data about elderlies in their communities. Due to Covid-19, we only collected a small dataset that may contain a part of noisy data. I used Influence Function Method proposed in [Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/koh17a/koh17a.pdf) to find those noisy data. However, existed code of influence function implemented using PyTorch was unable to be run successfully on our Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU. We tried to solve this problem...
